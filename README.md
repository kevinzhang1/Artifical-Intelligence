# Artifical-Intelligence

Project 0- This project is a brief introduction to the Python language and UNIX enviornment.

Project 1- This project is meant to have us implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

Project 2- This project has us have classic Pacman  modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. We implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

Project3- We implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
